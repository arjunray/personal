# Biography

I am a Postdoctoral Scholar with <a href="https://www.igib.res.in/?q=ShantanuSengupta">Dr.Shantu Sengputa</a> at CSIR-IGIB located in India. 

My long standing interest is to study and predict the 3D structure of proteins with high accuracy to enable docking studies of proteins with unknown x-ray structures.
